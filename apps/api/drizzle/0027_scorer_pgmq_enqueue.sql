-- services/scorer: pgmq enqueue ("Trigger A"). Replaces the HMAC-webhook moderation notifier with a
-- Postgres trigger that pgmq.send()s a scoring job ATOMICALLY with the content write — the job exists
-- only if the row committed (no lossy hop). Idempotent per repo convention (create extension if not
-- exists; create or replace; drop trigger if exists before create). pgmq is AT-LEAST-ONCE, so the
-- worker's downstream writes (moderation_analyses upsert, Neo4j MERGE) are idempotent.
--
-- Fires on entities and comments — on INSERT and on content-changing
-- UPDATEs. (chat_messages are NOT scored: Agora uses end-to-end-encrypted secure chat, so the server
-- never sees message plaintext — RoBERTa/Haiku scoring is impossible and meaningless there.)
-- The UPDATE trigger is GATED on the text column(s) actually changing, so the moderation
-- write-back itself (which only updates moderation_status) and trigger-maintained count/reaction
-- bumps do NOT re-enqueue (this is what prevents a write-back → re-score loop). INSERT and UPDATE are
-- separate triggers because a WHEN clause referencing OLD is invalid on an INSERT trigger.
--
-- Payload is id-only {targetType, targetId, projectId}; the worker fetches text / space / author by id.
-- This superseded the moderation half of apps/api/src/lib/webhooks.ts (MODERATION_EVENTS +
-- projects.moderation_webhook_url/secret), which has since been removed (migration 0035 drops the
-- columns); webhooks.ts now serves only the external project webhook + sign-up validation.

-- `create function` below fail with "no schema has been selected to create in". (Doesn't bite on
